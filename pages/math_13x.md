I started the Honors Advanced Math Calculus series in my Freshman Autumn
quarter at UW because I had (and still have) a desire to further understand and
learn about math. The course prioritizes learning the reasoning and derivation
of Calculus theories, which I find refreshing and suited to my learning. The
course is challenging, as it requires this deeper understanding and application
of the core teachings, and as such I've learned a lot from the course.

I've included my first midterm from Math 134 (@TODO: need to include the first
midterm) as it was the first time that I have had a test result in which I
did poorly, yet received a high score. It was a personal indication as to
the areas that I would need to focus on in future tests - particularly
pacing my time to better be able to answer harder problems.
