title: Clubs

In my first quarter at UW, I joined two clubs - the Society for Advanced Rocket
Propulsion and the Husky Robotics Club. So far, at the end of my first quarter,
they've been a blast. Here's a little bit about my involvement in both clubs,
and a link to some of the work I've done in them!

SARP - My main interest is to apply the learning from my major to real
problems, so to do that, I joined the Avionics and Recovery subteam. In this
subteam I have worked with others to develop our payload, and am leading a
project focusing on long range telemetry for our rocket. Code and project
details are on my Github at https://github.com/TarkanAl-Kazily/LoRa

Husky Robotics - In high school I was on a FIRST robotics team, so when I heard
about the Husky Robotics club I had to join. In the software subteam I've
worked with others to develop code for controlling and communicating with our
rover. Our project page is on Github at
